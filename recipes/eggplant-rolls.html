    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a vegetarian, low-carb, Greek-style recipe for rolled eggplant filled with the fresh flavor of mozzarella cheese and served with a fun, vibrant bell pepper sauce. 
    Ideal as a starter for a vegetarian dinner party. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>½ onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 red bell peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 eggplant, sliced lengthwise into strips</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package mozzarella cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>2 firm red tomatoes, finely cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook and stir onion until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bell peppers and reduce heat to low. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Pour in vegetable broth. Cook and stir for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Quickly brown eggplant slices - they should be tender enough to roll easily, but not so tender they break apart.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked red bell pepper mixture to the bowl of a food processor; pulse until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.</li>
        <li>Lay eggplant slices on a sheet of parchment paper. Spoon a little of the cheese mixture onto 1 end of an eggplant slice and roll up. Place eggplant roll in a casserole dish. Repeat with remaining eggplant and cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Serve with warm bell pepper sauce.</li>
    </ol>
