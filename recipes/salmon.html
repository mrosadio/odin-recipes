    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This savory dinner is restaurant-worthy, but can be prepped and cooked in under 30 minutes! If you are not a fan of fish, you can substitute thinly sliced or pounded chicken breasts for the salmon. Serve over pasta or rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (3 ounce) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ lemon, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Pour flour in a bowl and dredge salmon, shaking off the excess.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook salmon fillets until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour wine into the skillet and scrape browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and cook until garlic is fragrant and slightly brown and liquid is reduced by half, about 1 minute.
            Add chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Bring to a boil while stirring. Stir in butter until melted. Return salmon fillets to skillet and spoon sauce over them.</li>
        <li>Cook, turning fillets once, until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes. Serve salmon with sauce poured over it and garnish with lemon slices.</li>
    </ol>
